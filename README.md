# Udacity-RoboND-Projects
My Udacity projects for the Robotics Nanodegree course.

Do not try to ```catkin_make``` with more than one project in the same catkin workspace, some packages are reused and have the same name, so you will get an error.

More info in each project folder on how to compile and run.
